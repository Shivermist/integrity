Even if he wanted to, these services were in shortage and had long waitlists. \n What it does \n Otto is a personalised therapist that is available through SMS anytime. He is approachable, empathetic and shares authentic, heart-felt conversations with those who need it the most. Otto breaks the stigma around mental care support by seamlessly integrating into youth culture through texting, a common comfort zone for students.  \n He has many features such as authentic conversation; journaling, a popular mental health briefing strategy; a summary feature, offering the user an opportunity to step back and reflect on all the past conversations; an analytical tool, providing a way for professional therapists, doctors and parents to gain insights into user behaviour; and an emaling feature to email journal summaries. \n Target Audience : Students/Youth (However, all ages are able to use Otto) \n ",

When cameras in the fridge detect a food is ripe, the user is sent an SMS message along with some recipes.Our contact page \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Our about us page\n\nInspiration \n How many times have you seen that your produce (fruits/veggies) has gone rotten or has been aimlessly sitting around in your fridge? Every year, about 17% of fresh produce goes to waste for this reason; but it doesn’t have to be this way. FreshVision aims to solve this problem and to make cooking with healthy ingredients easier, all to ensure we minimize food waste, keep people healthy, and make peoples’ lives easier. We also aim to help achieve SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production in this way. \n What it does \n FreshVision solves this waste problem by making sure you know when your food is ripe and suggests recipes for you to use so that your food doesn’t sit around and go to waste. By using antifreeze cameras installed in your fridge, photos of your produce will be taken every 3 hours and sent to a machine learning model and web app to determine if anything is ripe. Whenever the model notices that something is ripe, the web app sends an SMS text message telling the user. The web app also accesses a recipe database that will showcase recipes for the ripe food to the user. As mentioned earlier, this will encourage users to cook with their produce, minimize food waste, and encourage healthy eating. The web app also contains an About Us and Contact page, fit for users to learn more about us and our mission. \n *Due to hardware limitations, the prototype currently accepts image uploads rather than taking them from antifreeze cameras. \n ",

    "project_2": "There is plenty of data about what makes you, you, but it's just siloed in a bunch of apps. Friended aims to build you a personal profile out of that data and help you build meaningful connections.\n\nInspiration \n We were inspired to make this project after we went through the process of finding a hackathon team ourselves. Though there exists a Discord channel and Devpost's features to filter through participants, we felt that they were not enough to help people reliably create teams. We felt that there was a method with greater clarity that could be established to help team members come together all while keeping compatibility in mind. That's where the idea of friended. was born.  \n What it does \n There is plenty of data about what makes you, you 😊. It’s just siloed in a bunch of apps 😔. That data is useful because it can help you find you’re next hackathon team, co-founder, friend, partner… \nfriended. brings your digital data into one place and finds people like you. It takes your interests, skills, and experiences from Devpost and LinkedIn and leverages OpenAI embeddings to allow for Supabase vector similarity search. This allows for use cases like helping hackathon organizers set up teams. Organizers can set up events for participants to meet and discover people participating in the hackathon with similar interests, skills, and work experiences. Ultimately, friended. helps you build meaningful connections through your pre-existing, public data. \n ",

We were all taught at a young age about how recycling reduces our carbon footprint, produces less waste, and is more sustainable for the planet.  So why is it that no one does it? Well, recycling is not always that simple. Firstly, it can be confusing to figure out what types of trash can be recycled. We have all stood in front of a trash can in confusion, wondering if our candy wrappers are recyclable or not. Secondly, recycling cans and trash cans are often placed apart, leading to laziness and unwillingness to track down the nearest recycling bin.

IntelliBin 2.0 uses a servo-motor-controlled arm to sort trash between two recycling bins.
