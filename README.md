# Integrity

Integrity is a simple tool to scan a hackathon project gallery for misconduct. It is designed to be used by hackathon organizers to quickly identify projects that may be in violation of the hackathon rules.

### Features

- Similarity Scanning (e.g. scans related devpost projects for plagiarism)
- Suspicious Commit Detection (e.g. commits made outside the hackathon time frame)
- Contributor Count Verification (e.g. ensuring that the project was built by the accepted team size)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies using `pipenv install`
3. Run the program using `streamlit run main.py`
